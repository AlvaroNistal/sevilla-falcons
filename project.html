					<h2>SevillaFalcons</h2>
					<p>Our breeding project aims to raise best quality falcons and to achieve this we got to respect certain parameters:</p>
					<p>- Keep a small number of proven quality specimens in optimal conditions of space, food, hygiene, etc...<br>
					- Avoiding industrialization by breeding a very large number of chicks<br>
					- Variety of fresh and the best quality food<br>
					- Exquisite management of chicks and young falcons throughout all the breeding process is the best way to hand it to the owner/falconer, virgins and without any bad experience</p>
				</li>
				<li class="switcher-content" id="tab2-content">
					<h2>Stud falcons</h2>
					<p>Our breeding falcons have been handled for hunting and selected based on physical conditions and excellent behavior.</p>
					<p>Our demand is that the studs pass on these morphological and psychological qualities to their offspring. This implies that any physical or behavioral defect involves the exclusion of our breeding centre.</p>
					<p>The aggressiveness and perseverance in hunting is our first priority because we know that they will be used in hunting and know the preferences of our customers.</p>
					<p>We try our best that all our falcons are in perfect condition, shape and color and pass it to their offspring.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li id="tab3-content" class="switcher-content">
					<h2>Breeding</h2>
					<p>We breed a small number of chicks because we understand is the only way to obtain first class falcons. We put all the effort in their care and to achieve a perfect development, this is the best way to achive a peerless plumage and corporal growth.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li id="tab4-content" class="switcher-content">
					<h2>Diet</h2>
					<p>It is true that all breeders say they give the best quality of food to their falcons, but reality seems to be very different. Most of them give low cost products such as one day chicks and mostly frozen food. Others use a diet that excludes fresh birds because they think the falcon will contract a disease.</p>
					<p>On the other hand, we are completely convinced and we know it from our experience, that a falcon during his development should have a similar diet to what he will get in his natural enviroment. That is why we use fresh food base on pigeons, rats, quail and even sparrows.</p>
					<p>This makes our falcons have a perfect devolpment and growth when they arrive to our customers who are used to give a varied diet. A good diet will help them be strong during training, during this stage falcons are vulnerable when they begin training and introduction on hunting to much effort cause them stress and immunodeficiency. </p>
					<p>It is obvious that if a falcon is raise with a diet that does not include the parasites from savage prey, in all probability will fall ill when it get in contact with them.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li id="tab5-content" class="switcher-content">
					<h2>Handling</h2>
					<p>We are completely aware that a bad handling of young falcons during the stay with parents, will live a bad experience if done during the day and in the presence of adults, who will transmit to their chicks that humans are dangerous. In that period of time we do not handle the chicks and avoid  they have any contact with humans.</p>
					<p>When we catch them for training, even for hacking, we do it at night and in absolute silence to avoid any type of bad memory with humans. When the falcon arrives to the falconer it will be completely virgin, perfect in character that will allow an easy and quick training.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li id="tab6-content" class="switcher-content">
					<h2>Development and conditions of life</h2>
					<p>We breed our chicks in Andalucía, completely outdoors with temperatures that overtake the 40ºC and hacking takes place in the same conditions.  When the falcons arrive to the arab countries they will suffer less and will tolerate better the heat.</p>
